CSS Margins and Padding
We can use CSS margins for creating space around elements. We can also do this from the borders of our previously defined elements.

See margin1.html

Margins have multiple properties. We can build space around certain elements. We can do it from their borders if we want. We can control them individually by side. We can color them individually too.
see margin2.html

The next example is about CSS inheritance and how margins are inherited.
See margin3.html.
