CSS Text notes
One of the things that we have to work on when developing and designing a website is formatting the texts and filling boxes in a way that displays best.  For that reason, CSS text formatting is an important feature because, without the text and the content, the website design is itself meaningless.

Text alignment
The text-alignment property tunes in the alignment of the text. We can make it go horizontally or vertically as required. We can center, right-align, or justify (relative center?). Each line will then be stretched to have equal width by default. Right/Left margins will be straight like newspapers or magazines.

Text Direction
We can use Unicode-bidi and direction properties to alter the direction of the text.
