CSS Text notes
One of the things that we have to work on when developing and designing a website is formatting the texts and filling boxes in a way that displays best.  For that reason, CSS text formatting is an important feature because, without the text and the content, the website design is itself meaningless.
see example1.html

Text alignment
The text-alignment property tunes in the alignment of the text. We can make it go horizontally or vertically as required. We can center, right-align, or justify (relative center?). Each line will then be stretched to have equal width by default. Right/Left margins will be straight like newspapers or magazines.

Text Direction
We can use Unicode-bidi and direction properties to alter the direction of the text.
see example2.html 

Vertical alignmentThe vertical-align property will set up vertical alignment for our HTML elements. We can add an image and set up vertical alignment for that too.
see example3.html 

Decoration
CSS allows us to use something called text-decoration. The property makes and removes decorations. If the value is none, the property will remove them.
text-decoration: overline, line-through, underline

Text Transformation
This specifies case in lettering...so...upper or lowercase.
text-transformation: uppercase, lowercase, capitalize.
capitalize only does first letter of a word.

Indentation
This indents the text of the first line.
text-indent: ?? px 

Letter Spacing
This is for spacing between letters.
letter-spacing: ?? px or -?? px

Height
We can set the height of lines by using line-height: and giving it 0 - 1 in point increments (.10,.20) (and beyond 2). This will set the line to be closer to the line above it, mashing the text together vertically.
