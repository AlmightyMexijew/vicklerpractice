The CSS selectors
CSS has simple selectors that select elements based on name, id, and class.
A combination of selectors can be used which will select elements by analyzing the relationships
There are pseudo-class selectors basted on a certain state of the HTML elements.
Attribute selectors focus on attributes (surprise) and the value of the attribute. (attribute is defined as the piece used to change the display or behavior of an element)
Pseudo-element selectors focus on a style of a certain element.
