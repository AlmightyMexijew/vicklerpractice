        <p>This is let on demonstration for us. Since Vickler skips it, we'll make an alert. If it pops up, it'll show the variables.</p>

        <script>
            let poop = "poop"
            let pee = "pee"
            alert(poop)
            alert(pee)
            alert(poop + pee)
            alert(poop + poop)
            alert(pee + pee)
        </script>
