Notes--CSS Boxes
The box model is an integral piece of the design and layout process in websites and web development. The box described by the box model is one that encloses an HTML element. It has borders, margins, padding, and the content inside (of course).  There are several parts to the model as we said, and the most important is the content.  This is where you put text aqnd insert images to be displayed.  The next biggest component is padding that clears areas of content. This padding itself is transparent.

The 3rd most important part of box model is the border. The border traces around your content and the inner padding. It encloses them inside itself completely. This forms "the box". After that is a less noticed 4th part: the margin.  Margins are clearing the areas around the borders and creating space to make the box look formatted and clean.  The margins are also, like padding, transparent. The box model adds a border around this element and defines the space from all the the other elements nearby.
In example 1, we will create the box model for demonstration.
