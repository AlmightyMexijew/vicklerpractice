        <h4>Learning the Box Model</h4>
        <p>If we dive deeper into the CSS box model, it turns out to be a box that engulfs each HTML element you want to emphasize.</p>
        <div>This is the place where you have to fill in the text. It has borders, appropriate padding, perfect margins, and some text you want your users to read. It can be a product description.</div>
