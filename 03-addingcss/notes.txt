Adding CSS:
Whenever the browser reads the style sheet it gets ready to format the page based on the information in the style sheet.  There are 3 ways to go about this:
1) External CSS (link ref to style sheet in folder)
2) Internal CSS (styling in <style> tag in <head>.)
3) Inline CSS (styling in the element itself)

The following index pages are the examples:
1) External --> index.html
2) Internal --> index2.html
3) Inline --> index3.html
