There are other ways to add color than just naming them (like blue; yellow; and so on).  There are several options available.
Option 1: HEX values -- Using hex values to arrive at a color.
Option 2: RGB values -- Using Red-Green-Blue (RGB) value to arrive at a color
Option 3: RGBA values -- like RGB but with A for alpha, which sets transparency.
Option 4: HSL values -- Using Hue-Saturation-Lightness values to arrive at a color.
Option 5: HSLA values -- HSL with the alpha transparency added.

Option 1: HEX. Hex is short for Hexadecimal, and in this context it's a color reference specified by a hexadecimal number.  The hex number has 6 digits and can be divided into 2 pairs of reds, greens, and blues. The hex integer specifies the color components.
Values are set in the form of 00 and ff. The ff value is the maximum value possible in hex, at 255.  The HEX colors are a mix of numbers and alphabets.
