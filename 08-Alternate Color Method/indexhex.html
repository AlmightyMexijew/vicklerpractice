        <p style="background-color:#ff0000";>As the first two spots are designated red, ff means 255 so you will see dense red: #ff0000</p>
        <p style="background-color:#0000ff;">The last two spots are designated blue. With double f, you will see dense blue: #0000ff</p>
        <p style="background-color:#3cb371;">This is a mix and it will produce sea green: #3cb3671</p>
        <p style="background-color:#gg10ff;">You cannot use any alphabet after f. If you do, you will see no color on the screen. If no color perturbs you, look out for the g, z or q. #gg10ff</p>
