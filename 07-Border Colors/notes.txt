Although border colors are not common for web pages, CSS provides you with the most effective way to add borders to HTML elements. When we write the code for a page, we are given the option and opportunity to set width of borders. This is nifty for distinguishing more paragraphs from each other.  When making a landing page, it's possible to use borders to enclose and color the "Call to Action" to make it prominent and eye-catching. Just like when we insert colors or something, we can also include borders.
